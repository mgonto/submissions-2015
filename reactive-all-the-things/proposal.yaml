  Title: Reactive all the things
  Description: >
    Angular is performant enough for most apps, most of the time;
    But what happens when you're trying to push every drop of performance out
    of your browser app? Making your Webapp performant and at the same time
    have nice, loosely coupled code based on resauble blocks is extremely hard.
    How would you handle a fire hose of data from socket pushes streaming to your UI
    while you've got mouse hover events firing? Reactive Programming is the answer to
    these questions.
    In this talk, we'll learn first what Reactive Programming really means and then
    we'll dive into practical examples on how Netflix is leveraging Reactive Programming
    to make performant, scalable and loosely coupled apps.
